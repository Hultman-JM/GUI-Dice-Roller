## GUI-Dice-Roller-for-D-D-5e
This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Tkinter in Python. It serves as a convenient tool for tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) enthusiasts, specifically those who play Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition (D&D 5e). The GUI Dice Roller allows users to simulate dice rolls commonly used in D&D 5e gameplay, such as rolling a d20 for skill checks, attack rolls, or saving throws. Additionally, the application supports modifiers and special mechanics unique to D&D 5e, such as advantage/disadvantage rolls and critical hits/fumbles. The primary goal of the project is to provide a user-friendly interface for rolling dice and resolving game mechanics, making it easier for players to engage in immersive TTRPG experiences without the need for physical dice.
